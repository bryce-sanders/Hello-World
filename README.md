# Overview

This project is a demonstration of my ability to use Git software and GitHub as a version control system for my personal, academic, and professional software engineering projects.

This software displays the message "Hello World!" to the terminal in yellow letters. The coloring of the message helps it to stand out ane be distinguished from other messages and text in the terminal.

This software was created to meet the requirements of an academic assignment.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
